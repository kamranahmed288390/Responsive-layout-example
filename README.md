This repository contains several examples demonstrating how to create responsive web layouts using various modern CSS techniques and frameworks. Each file showcases a different approach to structuring and styling a web page.

## üìÅ Files Overview

### 1. `bootstrap.html`
Demonstrates the use of the **Bootstrap 5** framework for creating responsive grid layouts. It includes:

### 2. `flexbox.html`
An example of layout using **CSS Flexbox**:
- A `.flex-container` flex parent with four child `.card` elements.
- Custom flex grow/shrink values are applied using `.first` and `.second` classes.
- Layout adjusts proportionally using `flex` properties.

### 3. `grid.html`
Shows the use of **CSS Grid Layout**:
- A `.grid-container` defines a grid with two columns and three rows.
- Grid items span across columns using `grid-column: span 2`.

### 4. `index.html`
Same as `grid.html` ‚Äì another demonstration of **CSS Grid** with identical layout and structure.

### 5. `media-query.html`
Highlights the use of **CSS Media Queries**:
- A purple box (`div`) initially set to 500x500 pixels.
- Changes to 200x200 pixels on screens smaller than 600px wide.
- Useful for understanding basic responsive behavior using media queries.
